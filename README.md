## ⚡ How to Add or Activate Drive Links for 5th–8th Semesters

When you receive the Google Drive folder links for 5th, 6th, 7th, or 8th semester, open [`js/resources-data.js`](js/resources-data.js) and simply paste the URLs into the `DRIVE_FOLDERS` object:

```javascript
const DRIVE_FOLDERS = {
  SEM_3: "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10A22FDHw3j7eA5kIDYn6FzdEhDXj8HKC",
  SEM_4: "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eTAomKSCOVdGVzwWvMAuI4Y-z9eiLtEl",
  
  // Paste your new links here:
  SEM_5: "PASTE_5TH_SEM_DRIVE_LINK_HERE",
  SEM_6: "PASTE_6TH_SEM_DRIVE_LINK_HERE",
  SEM_7: "PASTE_7TH_SEM_DRIVE_LINK_HERE",
  SEM_8: "PASTE_8TH_SEM_DRIVE_LINK_HERE",

  COMBINED: "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OHt9JDq2Va4piknGYh2rDRKOCKJKuct6"
};
```

**That's it!** The website will automatically replace the "Resources coming soon" badges with active **"Open in Google Drive"** buttons across the homepage, dedicated semester pages, and search cards.
